### Superscript & Subscript

A subscript or superscript is a number, figure, symbol, or indicator that is smaller than the normal line of type and is set slightly below or above it – subscripts appear at or below the baseline, while superscripts are above. Subscripts and superscripts are perhaps best known for their use in formulas, mathematical expressions, and specifications of chemical compounds and isotopes, but have many other uses as well.

```markdown
Ordinal indicators are sometimes written as superscripts (1^st^, 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^, rather than 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th), although many English-language style guides recommend against this use. Other languages use a similar convention, such as 1^er^ or 2^e^ in French, or 4ª and 4º in Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish.

Also in mathematics and computing, a subscript can be used to represent the radix, or base, of a written number, especially where multiple bases are used alongside each other. For example, comparing values in hexadecimal, denary, and octal one might write C~hex~ = 12~dec~ = 14~oct~.
