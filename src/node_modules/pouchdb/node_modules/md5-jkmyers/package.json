Myers' high performance (in fact, the fastest) MD5 implementation for npm, Bower, Component, etc.\n\n[![Endorse on Coderwall](http://api.coderwall.com/andreaspizsa/endorsecount.png)](http://coderwall.com/andreaspizsa)\n[![Built with Grunt](https://cdn.gruntjs.com/builtwith.png)](http://gruntjs.com/)\n\nThis MD5 implementation was written by [Joseph K. Myers](http://www.myersdaily.org/joseph/javascript/md5-text.html) and is currently the fastest according to [jsperf](http://jsperf.com/md5-shootout). I've wrapped it up as a universal module ([UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd)) for easy consumption with [Bower](https://github.com/bower/bower), [Component](https://github.com/component/component), npm, [RequireJS](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs) ([AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD)), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS), etc...\n\n\n## Usage\nThe module exports a single function that takes one parameter:\n```javascript\nmd5(String)\n```\n\n### On the Client\n#### Bower\n\n    bower install md5-jkmyers\n\n#### Component\n    component install md5-jkmyers\n\nThen in your `html`, do\n\n```html\n <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"bower_components/md5-jkmyers/md5.min.js\"></script>\n <script type=\"text/javascript\">\n   console.log(md5('hello, world!'));\n </script>\n```\n\n \n### On the Server\n#### node.js\n\nPlease be aware that node already comes with MD5 built in - see [here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11869589/199263). Having said that, `md5-jkmyers`  might still be a good and fast alternative (please feel free to contribute perfomance testst):\n\n    npm install md5-jkmyers\n    \nThen in your code do\n\n    md5 = require('md5')\n    md5('hello, world!')\n\n   \n## Contributors\n\n- Joseph K.
