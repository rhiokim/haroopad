  "readme": "readdir.js\n===========\n\nA Node.js utility module to read the contents of a directory with support for Ant style filtering to easily order the results - particularly useful for any order specific build system.\n\n\nNode.js\n=======\n\nInstall using npm `npm install readdir` then use with require:\n\n    var directoryContents = require('readdir').readSync('some_path/');\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThe `readSync( path, [filters, [options]])` method can accept a path that is either absolute or relative to the current working directory.\n\nFilters can be supplied as an array of strings that are Ant style expressions that any file found in the `path` directory must satisfy, use a `*` to signify any file in the current directory or `**` to signify any file in the current or any sub directory. If the filter contains a `/` then the file path must also include a path, so `*/*` would mean any file of a directory that is a direct sub-directory of the path directory and `*/**` would be any file that is in any subdirectory of the path directory.\n\nTo select just one type of file, add a file extension suffix to the filter (eg: `**.js` to pick any JavaScript file in the path directory).\n\nIf the options argument is supplied, it should be a number representing the sum of any options you want to apply:\n\n`ABSOLUTE_PATHS` changes the return value so that each item in the array is an absolute path instead of relative to the path directory.\n\n`CASELESS_SORT` sort the return array as a case insensitive sort\n\n`CASE_SORT` sort the return array as a case sensitive sort\n\n`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` include the names of directories in the results returned, including just directories can be done by using the filter `['*/']`, note that directory names will have a trailing slash to identify them from files that have no extension\n\n`INCLUDE_HIDDEN` includes files in directories that have a `.` prefix, note that this doesn't impact whether files with a `.` prefix are returned (ie: `.gitignore` would be listed, but `.git/*` would not)\n\n`NON_RECURSIVE` prevents the automatic recursion so only the current directory is scanned\n\n\nExamples\n========\n\nWith filters:\n\n    var readDir = require('readdir');\n\n    // an array of all JavaScript files in some_path/\n    readDir.readSync( 'some_path/', ['**.js'] );\n\nWith ordering of results using filters:\n\n    var readDir = require('readdir');\n\n    // an array of all JavaScript files in some_path/ with base.js first, then all core then anything else\n    var filesArray = readDir.readSync( 'some_path/', ['base.js', 'core/**.js', '**.js'] );\n\n    // an array of all JavaScript files in some_path/ with base.js first, then all core then anything else\n    readDir.read( 'some_path/', ['base.js', 'core/**.js', '**.js'], function (err, filesArray) {\n       // err either null or an error instance\n       // filesArray the same as the return value from readSync\n    });\n\nWith options\n\n    var readDir = require('readdir');\n\n    // an array of all files in some_path/ as absolute file paths\n    readDir.readSync( 'some_path/', null, readDir.ABSOLUTE_PATHS );\n\n    // an array of all files in some_path/ as absolute file paths sorted without case\n    readDir.read( 'some_path/', readDir.ABSOLUTE_PATHS + readDir.CASELESS_SORT, function (err, allFiles) {});\n\n    // an array of just directory names directly under some_path\n    readDir.read( 'some_path/', ['*/'], readDir.INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES + readDir.NON_RECURSIVE,\n      function (err, allFiles) {});\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
