### stringex.js

> A semi-port of rsl/stringex from ruby to node.js

This is more or less intended to be a complete port of rsl/stringex (Ruby/Rails stringex lib).
So far this package is more or less feature complete, but there are probably a lot of
improvements that can be made. I'll try my best to seek out my failures, but please
report issues to me via github so I can tackle them as quickly as possible. Thanks.

### Features

 - Unicode <=> ASCII transliteration
 - Character conversion
 - Useful string manipulations
 - Easy to use, yet feature-complete slug generator via stringex.toUrl()
