# grunt-contrib-connect [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect)

> Start a connect web server.



## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.0`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-contrib-connect --save-dev
```

One the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-connect');
```




## Connect task
_Run this task with the `grunt connect` command._

Note that this server only runs as long as grunt is running. Once grunt's tasks have completed, the web server stops. This behavior can be changed with the [keepalive](#keepalive) option, and can be enabled ad-hoc by running the task like `grunt connect:keepalive`.

This task was designed to be used in conjunction with another task that is run immediately afterwards, like the [grunt-contrib-qunit plugin](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-qunit) `qunit` task.
### Options

#### port
Type: `Integer`
Default: `8000`

The port on which the webserver will respond. The task will fail if the specified port is already in use.

#### hostname
Type: `String`
Default: `'localhost'`

The hostname the webserver will use.

#### base
Type: `String`
Default: `'.'`

The base (or root) directory from which files will be served. Defaults to the project Gruntfile's directory.

#### keepalive
Type: `Boolean`
Default: `false`

Keep the server alive indefinitely. Note that if this option is enabled, any tasks specified after this task will _never run_. By default, once grunt's tasks have completed, the web server stops. This option changes that behavior.

This option can also be enabled ad-hoc by running the task like `grunt connect:targetname:keepalive`

#### middleware
Type: `Function`
Default:

```js
function(connect, options) {
  return [
    // Serve static files.
    connect.static(options.base),
    // Make empty directories browsable.
    connect.directory(options.base),
  ];
}
```

Lets you add in your own Connect middlewares. This option expects a function that returns an array of middlewares. See the [project Gruntfile][] and [project unit tests][] for a usage example.

[project Gruntfile]: Gruntfile.js
[project unit tests]: test/connect_test.js

### Usage examples

#### Basic Use
In this example, `grunt connect` (or more verbosely, `grunt connect:server`) will start a static web server at `http://localhost:9001/`, with its base path set to the `www-root` directory relative to the gruntfile, and any tasks run afterwards will be able to access it.

```javascript
// Project configuration.
grunt.initConfig({
  connect: {
    server: {
      options: {
        port: 9001,
        base: 'www-root'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

If you want your web server to use the default options, just omit the `options` object. You still need to specify a target (`uses_defaults` in this example), but the target's configuration object can otherwise be empty or nonexistent. In this example, `grunt connect` (or more verbosely, `grunt connect:uses_defaults`) will start a static web server using the default options.

```javascript
// Project configuration.
grunt.initConfig({
  connect: {
    uses_defaults: {}
  }
});
```

#### Multiple Servers
You can specify multiple servers to be run alone or simultaneously by creating a target for each server. In this example, running either `grunt connect:site1` or `grunt connect:site2` will  start the appropriate web server, but running `grunt connect` will run _both_. Note that any server for which the [keepalive](#keepalive) option is specified will prevent _any_ task or target from running after it.

```javascript
// Project configuration.
grunt.initConfig({
  connect: {
    site1: {
      options: {
        port: 9000,
        base: 'www-roots/site1'
      }
    },
    site2: {
      options: {
        port: 9001,
        base: 'www-roots/site2'
      }
    }
  }
});
```

#### Roll Your Own
Like the [Basic Use](#basic-use) example, this example will start a static web server at `http://localhost:9001/`, with its base path set to the `www-root` directory relative to the gruntfile. Unlike the other example, this is done by creating a brand new task. in fact, this plugin isn't even installed!

```javascript
// Project configuration.
grunt.initConfig({ /* Nothing needed here! */ });

// After running "npm install connect --save-dev" to add connect as a dev
// dependency of your project, you can require it in your gruntfile with:
var connect = require('connect');

// Now you can define a "connect" task that starts a webserver, using the
// connect lib, with whatever options and configuration you need:
grunt.registerTask('connect', 'Start a custom static web server.', function() {
  grunt.log.writeln('Starting static web server in "www-root" on port 9001.');
  connect(connect.static('www-root')).listen(9001);
});
```
